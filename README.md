# 🗺 Roadmap
Future work About this would be as below :
   1. Interegrate Payment Network with this app for online Payment
   2. Show history for your booking in app itself.
   3. send notification in telegram for your booking as well as email
   4.  Many more others in Future.

 I will try to add this as soon as possible. This is totally for education about Qt and Python. Will share more update once any of functionallity is completed.
